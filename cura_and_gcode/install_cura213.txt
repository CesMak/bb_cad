Cura 2 with Octoprint

Download and install cura 2.1.3 and setup for Octoprint!
Install

    Download the machine profiles for Octoprint
    Extract the zip and add the included files into your Cura 2 machines folder
        Windows: .../Cura 2.1/resources/machines/
        Linux: ~/.local/share/cura/machines (source)
            You will also have to copy the following files from /opt/cura/share/cura/resources/machines to ~/.local/share/cura/machines as otherwise slicing fails with an error:
                fdmprinter.json
                ultimaker.json
                ultimaker2.json
                ultimaker2plus.json
    Restart Cura 2
    Now you should be able to select the printer "Ultimaker 2+ with Octoprint"
        Click Add Printer form the "Printer:" drop down menu
        Select "Ultimaker 2+ with Octoprint"
        You may have to reimport your settings
Usage

Important: Never try to print regular sliced files via Octoprint! Only those sliced using the "Ultimaker 2+ with Octoprint" will work properly.

    Go to http://um2.sim.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/
    Login as sim (default pw)
    Upload your GCODE (And again: Must be sliced as "Ultimaker 2+ with Octoprint")
    Hit the small "load icon" under your uploaded gcode
    Check if your GCODE was loaded correctly (using the GCODE Viewer tab)
    Afterwards you can hit Print
    Please delete your GCODE after use (if not needed anymore)
